# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:

  
     - family: IranSans
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/iransans.ttf 
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
     - family: BNazanin
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/bnazanin.ttf
     - family: BTitr
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/btitr.ttf
     - family: ArialRegular
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/arialregular.ttf 
     - family: Courier

         - asset: assets/fonts/courier.ttf 
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
